    /*
    Write a function that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line.
    However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively.
    If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words
     Codility, Test and Coders in this given order.
  For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replac√©e by CodilityTest
   and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.

For example, here is the output for N = 24:
1
Codility
Test
Codility
Coders
CodilityTest
7
Codility
Test
Codi1ityCoders
11
CodilityTest
13

 If `output` is still empty after all checks, we just set it to the string representation of the number.

Finally, we print `output` on a separate line using `System.out.println()`.
